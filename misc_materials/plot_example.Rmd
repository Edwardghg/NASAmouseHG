This is an R Markdown document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. 

To view the output of plots in your Rmarkdown file in GitHub, make sure `output` is set to ` rmarkdown::github_document` above. This will create a Markdown (.md) version of your file with the plots embedded when you "Knit" the file in RStudio with `knitR`.
