### 2.1. Open-Source, Freely Available Programs
All customized software we developed for this study are open source and freely available. We utilize the programming language R [(R Core Team 2017)](https://www.r-project.org/), which is primarily designed for statistical computing and graphics. We supplement the base R software environment with "R packages" - curated R code collections loaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network [(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/). The specific packages used are detailed under Computation Implementation (Section 2.5.). All development of the source code was performed in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), a integrated development environment for R. The current script and its past iterations are both stored on the repository [GitHub](https://github.com/eghuang/NASAmouseHG). The script is freely offered for use or modification under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/eghuang/NASAmouseHG/blob/master/LICENSE). There is no warranty on the script, implied or otherwise.

Notation. dose $d$, effect $E$. Related notations are: $E(d: \textbf{p})$ where $d$ is dose and $\textbf{p}$ is a vector of adjustable parameters that are calibrated by regression from the data; $E_j(d_j; \mathbf{p_j})$ when discussiong a mixture whose $j^{th}$ component contributed dose $d_j$ to the total mixture dose, with $j = 1, 2, \dots, N$; and $E(d; \textbf{p}; L)$ when LET $L$ is used instead of an integer label $j$.

The data are sourced from Chang et al. (2016) and Alpen et al. (1993, 1994) and implemented as R dataframes throughout the calculations. A number of R packages from the CRAN repository were used, notably `stats` for non-linear regression, `deSolve` for solving differential equations, `mvtnorm` for Monte Carlo simulations, and `ggplot2` for plotting.  

Our computational workflow with respect to R computational methods and functions is as follows. Various datasets on Harderian gland tumorgenesis are first implemented as R dataframe structures. Inverse variance weighted non-linear least square models are fitted over these dataframes using the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Coefficients extracted from the models are used to construct hazard functions in the form of a user-written R function. Standardized IDERs are initialized from these hazard functions as user-written functions following the hazard function equation in Section 2.2.2. These resulting IDERs encompass various 1-ion beam variants (HZE, low-LET) and effect models (TE, NTE + TE).  

Computing $I(d)$ involves calling a user-written R function `calculate_complex_id` that applies incremental effect additivity to mixtures of $N \geq 2.5.1$ IDERs, with at most one low-LET IDER. `calculate_complex_id` takes an argument to specify use of either the NTE+TE or the TE model. Calculation of $I(d)$ requires construction of an R vector `dE` with elements corresponding to the derivative of each IDER curve as a function of dose. A one-dimensional root finder `uniroot` is used to find the incremental effect of each IDER. We construct `dI`, a vector corresponding to the numerical derivative of $I(d)$ with respect to mixture dose d by applying Eq. (2.2.2.1) to each element of `dE`. A numerical ODE integrator from `deSolve` is used to integrate `dI` with a Radau method to return a R list of dose-effect coordinates.

Confidence intervals for the calculated baseline MIXDER $I(d)$ are found through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. A vector of total-mixture dose points is chosen. For each MC iteration, a user-written function `generate_ci` initializes a vector of $N$ random parameter value samples from multivariate distributions determined during IDER fitting. These samples are drawn with the `rmvnorm` function from the `mvtnorm` package. An $I(d)) dose effect relation is calculated at that dosage, using the sample parameters, with `calculate_complex_id`. When the MC step is completed a 95% confidence interval at meach dose point sorted by effect size. The naive confidence intervals are also computed within `generate_ci` by choosing parameters using each parameter marginal distribution instead of using variance-covariance matrices.
